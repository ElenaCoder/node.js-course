## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a secure RESTful API that allows users to interact with a **customer** database.
The API endpoints are protected using authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and password hashing with bcrypt.
The root endpoint of the REST API is http://localhost:3000/api/customers.

REST API has following endpoints and actions:

| Method and endpoint        | Action                                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET /api/customers         | Fetch all customers                                                            |
| GET /api/customers/{id}    | Fetch customer by id. Id is sent in the route parameter                        |
| POST /api/customers        | Add new customer- New customer is sent inside the request body                 |
| DELETE /api/customers/{id} | Delete customer by id. Id is sent in the route parameter                       |
| PUT /api/customers/{id}    | Edit customer by id.                                                           |
|                            | Id is sent in the route parameter and updated customer inside the request body |


## Features

- Fetch all customers: Retrieve a list of all customers in the database.
- Fetch customer by ID: Get the details of a customer by their unique ID.
- Add new customer: Create a new customer entry in the database.
- Delete customer by ID: Remove a customer record from the database.
- Update customer by ID: Modify the details of a customer in the database.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Postman
- Mocha
- Chai
- Chai-HTTP
- jsonwebtoken
- bcrypt

## How to Use

1. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

2. [Database Setup](#database-setup): Set up a PostgreSQL database server and create a database called "customer". Run the provided SQL statements to create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.

3. Configuration: Update the database connection details in the `dbconfig.js` file to match your PostgreSQL database credentials.

4. Installation: Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the project dependencies:
  `npm install`


5. Start the Server: Run the following command to start the server:
  `npm start`

6. Authentication: To access protected endpoints, include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests. You can obtain a token by making a POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint with valid user credentials. The response will include a token that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
   **Obtaining the JWT Token:**
   To obtain a JWT token, we will use Postman. Follow these steps:
   - Open Postman and create a new request.
   - Set the HTTP method to POST.
   - Enter the following URL: http://localhost:3000/login.
   - Select the "Body" tab.
   - Choose the "raw" option.
   - Set the body format to JSON (application/json). Specify the Content-Type header as application/json.
   - In the request body, enter the following JSON:
         ```
         {
            "email":"john@john.com",
            "password":"john007"
         }
         ```
   - Click the "Send" button to make the request.
   - The response from the /login endpoint will include a JWT token. Copy this token from the response body.
   **Screenshots of obtaining JWT Token:**

    - [request body](./assets/6.2-obtaining-jwt-token_2.jpg)


   **Include JWT Token:**
    To access protected endpoints, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests.
    Here's an example using Postman:
      - Create a new request in Postman for a protected endpoint (e.g., GET /api/customers).
      - Set the HTTP method to the appropriate method (e.g., GET).
      - Set the request URL to http://localhost:3000/api/customers.
      - In the request headers, add a new header with the key Authorization and the value Bearer <your-jwt-token>.
      - Replace <your-jwt-token> with the actual JWT token.
      - Click the "Send" button to make the request. You should receive a response with the desired data from the protected endpoint.

## Database Setup

To set up the PostgreSQL database for the **customer** Database REST API, follow these steps:

**customer** table:
  1. Install PostgreSQL: If you haven't already, download and install PostgreSQL from the official website (https://www.postgresql.org) based on your operating system.

  2. Open a terminal or command prompt and connect to your PostgreSQL server using the appropriate credentials.
    Create a Postgre database called **customer** using the following SQL statement.
    `CREATE DATABASE customer;`
  3. Connect to the customer database (`\c customer` command) and create a table called **customers** into the customer database using the following SQL statement.
      ```
      CREATE TABLE customers (
        id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        firstname VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL,
        lastname VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL,
        phone VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL
      );
      ```
  4. Populate the customers table using the SQL statement below.
      ```
      INSERT INTO customers (firstname, lastname, email, phone) VALUES ('John', 'Johnson', 'john@johnson.com', '8233243');
      INSERT INTO customers (firstname, lastname, email, phone) VALUES ('Mary', 'Smith', 'mary@smith.com', '6654113');
      INSERT INTO customers (firstname, lastname, email, phone) VALUES ('Peter', 'North', 'peter@north.com', '901176');
      ```
  5. Check that customers are added to the customers table
      `SELECT * FROM customers;`

**users** table:
  1. Connect to the customer database (`\c customer` command) and create a table called **users** into the customer database using the following SQL statement.
      ```
        CREATE TABLE users (
          id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
          password TEXT NOT NULL
        );
      ```
  2. Create within the users table one user for testing purposes. Populate the users table using the SQL statement below.
    **Note!** The password is hashed and plain text password is *john007*.
      ```
        INSERT INTO users
          (email, password)
        VALUES
          ('john@john.com', '$2b$08$XX615l/tHyDneJ.A1CJZZu1CSo6RAEJyEReozQC.yoObjKcOCxkPe');
      ```
  3. Check that customers are added to the customers table
      `SELECT * FROM users;`


## Manual testing

To test the API endpoints, you can use tools like **cURL** or **Postman**. Here are some example requests:

- Fetch all customers:
GET http://localhost:3000/api/customers

- Fetch customer by ID:
GET http://localhost:3000/api/customers/{id}


- Add new customer:
POST http://localhost:3000/api/customers
Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
  }


- Delete customer by ID:
DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/customers/{id}


- Update customer by ID:
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/customers/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
  }

## Automated integration testing
To test the API endpoints, the project utilizes the **Mocha** testing framework along with the **Chai** assertion library and **Chai-HTTP** plugin.
The tests are written in JavaScript and can be found in the test directory.

To run the tests, use the following command:

`npm test`

Make sure the server is running before executing the tests.
